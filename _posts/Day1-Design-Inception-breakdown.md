# 20130422 Day 1: Design Inception
- Spent the day in inception. ID'ed Goals, Risks, Users. Generated
several Lean hypotheses. Dot-voted and reached consensus that
"Memento" was the best starting point. Ended the day agreeing to dig
deeper on Memento, and reconvene the whole group on Wednesday.

# 20130423 Day 2: Regroup

- LG and JPB spend the day digging in to Memento. Did some research,
looked into what UGC is currently available. Did some competitive
analysis and found hashtag browsers as an emerging category. Picked a
sample concert and researched UGC content. Concerned about minimal /
scattered content, we dug deeper into the opportunities available to
us in-venue.

# 20130424 Day 3: Design Studio
- This morning we started with a "stand-up", rehashing what the team
had done yesterday.
- Next, we briefly discussed our current thinking around a putative
Memento app, as well as what an on-site in-concert app might deliver
us.
- We followed up with an intense day of Design Studio, doing 4
iterations of sketching, presenting, critique, and repeating.
- A well-timed walk around 4pm recharged us, and we regrouped by
setting out next steps and taking a high-level view of process. We
also identified areas we want to ensure we don't miss.

# 20130425 Day 4: Digest + Refine

- We started out by reviewing the day's agenda:

  - revisit old sketches
  - catalog our assumptions
  - catalog our mini-apps; each is a facet of the grand vision
  - pick one to do first / prioritize
  - break down into epics

- ...and we dived in! We started off tagging yesterday's Design Studio
sketches to find common elements. We identified an initial list:

- Feet Locator (Micro Check-Ins)
- Sweet Potato (Broadcast Msg)
- Glomento (Memento)
- Beholder (Multi Video)
- Beer Me (Drink Buying)
- Foot Count (Venue Analytics)
- Free Bird (Polling)
- Glow Stick (Light Toy)

- Next, we broke down each one and identified the User Intent,
Hypothesis, MVP, Assumptions, and link back to the bigger vision. A
few of the initial facets fractured into smaller concerns, so at one
point we dot-voted to prioritize which we wanted to pursue.

- In the middle of this exercise, MSB said "I'm concerned we're not
tying this back to the original vision." He drew six axes on a
whiteboard, and we mapped each facet on a 0-3 scale, creating a spider
chart.

  - Memorialize / Personalize
  - Liquidize Cred
  - Extend Usage of app (Viral Coefficient)
  - On-site Excitement
  - Increase Attendance
  - Increase Discovery
  - This did a great job of identifying the assets of each facet; what
about the liabilities? We made a risk spider chart w/ six axes, and
plotted each facet against it:

  - Technically Hard
  - Creepy
  - Tough User Adoption
  - Tough Venue Adoption
  - Tough Artist Adoption
  - Tough Sell to Stakeholders

- Long day! We drafted tomorrow's agenda before breaking for the day:

  - draw spiders
  - revisit prioritization
  - create release narrative
  - epics
  - retro

- Lauren and I spent the rest of the day cleaning up some of the
documentation and briefing the rest of the Pivotal team (Schubert and
Grippi). JPB stayed up late working on pretty versions of the spider
graphs (now called Rose Charts.)


# 20130426 Day 5: Distill Epics

- review Agenda for today
- review Rose Charts and revisit prioritization
- We agreed to derive epics for the following:

  - feet locator + foot count
  - free bird
  - glomento

- Derive epics! We created User Journeys and then Epics for each. Feet
Locator was renamed Marco Polo, and Foot Count quickly followed. Free
Bird was next (yes, we played Skynryd for inspiration) and Glo Stick
jumped in naturally as a feature set. Finally we addressed Glomento.

- Lunch! Then we started drafting the Release Narrative, to make sure
we could satisfactorily map everything back to the original vision.
20m in, MSB and MB felt strongly enough that we stopped.
